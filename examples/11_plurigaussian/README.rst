Plurigaussian Field Generation
==============================

Plurigaussian field simulations (PGS) are used to simulate correlated fields
of categorical data, e.g. lithofacies, hydrofacies, soil types, or
cementitious materials.
PGS uses one spatial random field (SRF) per dimension, e.g. two SRFs, when
working with two dimensional data. Furthermore, PGS needs a field, which
describes the categorical data and its spatial relations.
This might sound more complicated then it is, as we will see in the following
examples.
